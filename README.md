php_address_parser
==================

This is a php address parser for addresses in the United States. It identifies the different parts of an address and returns it in XML format.

To use the address parser, pass a string to the file index.php using GET. The string name should be "address". The parsed address will be returned in XML format.

The address string can be any format of address. An example is: "1234 1st Street, Tacoma, WA 98404 USA"

This address parser was written by Matt Nutsch.
